# 1. Slides

## Section Overview

The slide deck (`panel1_body.tex`) contains **28 content frames** organized into **7 sections** plus a wrap-up, with 2 discussion frames added after pedagogy review:

| Section | Key Content |
|---------|-------------|
| 1. What is panel data? | Definition, notation, panel structure table |
| 2. Why panel data? | Motivating example (cross-sectional scatter), spurious correlation, OVB intuition |
| 3. The within estimator | Demeaning derivation, within/between variation, FE = LSDV equivalence |
| 4. Interpretation and limits | What FE identifies, what it cannot control for, time-invariant variables dropping out |
| 5. Two-way fixed effects | Adding time FEs, absorbing common shocks, `feols()` syntax |
| 6. Random effects | GLS vs FE, RE assumption, Hausman test |
| Wrap-up | Summary table, next session preview |

## Compilation Status

- **Presentation PDF (`panel1.pdf`)**: 132 pages -- PASS (0 errors, 2 hbox warnings < 2.15pt)
- **Notes PDF (`panel1_notes.pdf`)**: 18 pages -- PASS (0 errors)
- **Overfull hbox > 10pt**: 0 (threshold: 3 or fewer allowed)

## Pedagogy Review

One critical issue identified and fixed:

- **Zero Socratic questions** on any slide
- **Fix**: Added two discussion frames:
  1. After cross-sectional scatter: *"Does unemployment cause lower approval? What else might explain this pattern?"*
  2. Before TWFE section: *"FE controls for everything time-invariant. But what if something happens in 2008 that affects all states simultaneously?"*

## Visual Audit Fixes

Two vbox overflow issues fixed:

| Frame | Overflow Before Fix | Fix Applied |
|-------|--------------------|--------------------|
| "Panel data: the basic structure" | +7.83pt | Reduced tikz row `minimum height` from 0.7cm to 0.6cm |
| "The within (demeaning) estimator" | +33.47pt (-> +11.47pt after first attempt) | Restructured to single displayed equation; removed intermediate mean derivation step |

One hbox overflow also fixed:

| Frame | Overflow | Fix Applied |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| "Motivating example" tikzpicture | +10.67pt | Repositioned axis labels within frame boundary (x-axis shortened to 9.5, labels moved to x=7.5/5.8) |

## Images Needed

No external images required. All diagrams are built with TikZ (scatter plot, equations, panel structure table).

# 2. Assignment

**File:** `assign5_panel1.tex` -> 7-page PDF -- PASS

## Structure

| Part | Section | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Part 1 (in-class) | 1.1 | Setup and data exploration |
| | 1.2 | Pooled OLS |
| | 1.3 | Entity fixed effects (`fixest`) |
| | 1.4 | Two-way fixed effects |
| Part 2 (take-home) | 2.1 | Data exploration |
| | 2.2 | Pooled OLS baseline |
| | 2.3 | Fixed effects models |
| | 2.4 | Random effects and Hausman test (`plm`) |

## Datasets

- **Presidential approval**: `presidential_approval.dta` -- 50 U.S. states x 73 years (unbalanced); variables: `State`, `StCode`, `Year`, `PresApprov`, `UnemPct`, `South`
- **Teaching evaluations**: `teaching_evals.dta` -- 48 instructors, 254 courses; variables: `Eval`, `Apct`, `Enrollment`, `Required`, `InstrID`, `CourseID`, `Year`
- Both available at `github.com/franvillamil/AQM2`

## Checker Results and Fixes

Two critical bugs found and fixed:

1. **State name error**: `"New York"` -> `"NewYork"` -- dataset has no spaces in state names; code would have silently returned an empty filtered dataset
2. **`pdata.frame` index**: `c("InstrID", "Year")` -> `c("InstrID", "CourseID")` -- instructors teach multiple courses per year, so `InstrID + Year` is not a valid unique panel index

## Items Requiring Attention

- **Deadline**: Set to `March 19, before class` -- confirm this is correct

## Files Created

| File | Knit Status | Size |
|------|-------------|------|
| `assign5_panel1_part1.Rmd` | PASS | 242 KB PDF |
| `assign5_panel1_part2.Rmd` | PASS | 150 KB PDF |
| `assign5_panel1_part1.R` | (script, not knitted) | n/a |
| `assign5_panel1_part2.R` | (script, not knitted) | n/a |

## Key Design Choices

- Data loaded from GitHub raw URLs (same as existing solution files)
- `output = "markdown"` in all `modelsummary()` calls for proper PDF table rendering
- `fig.height = 3.5` for all plots
- Part 2 explicitly explains why `InstrID + CourseID` is the correct panel index (a common student error)
- OVB direction in teaching evals is framed conditionally (explanation covers what to infer from whichever direction the coefficient shifts)

# 4. Issues Requiring Attention

| Priority | Item |
|----------|------|
| Low | Confirm assignment deadline: `March 19, before class` |

No other issues. All critical bugs fixed; all artifacts compile/knit cleanly.
