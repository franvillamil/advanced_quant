# Slides

## Section Overview

The slide deck (`computing_body.tex`) contains **27 content frames** organized into **6 sections**:

| Section | Slides | Key Content |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Introduction | 3 | Why computing practices matter, motivating discussion prompt |
| Project Organization | 5 | Task folders, workflow_example tree, file naming, R/LaTeX integration, Makefiles |
| Writing Better Code | 5 | DRY principle, constants, checks/assertions, print diagnostics, code style |
| Plain Text and Tools | 4 | Why plain text, code editors, command line, discussion prompt |
| Version Control with Git | 5 | Git recap, .gitignore, commit habits, GitHub replication, collaboration |
| Wrap-up | 4 | Resources, summary, next week, questions |

## Compilation Status

- **Presentation PDF**: 152 pages (including animation steps), compiles cleanly
- **Notes PDF**: 17 pages, compiles cleanly
- **Overfull hbox warnings > 10pt**: 0
- **LaTeX errors**: 0

## Pedagogy Review Summary

The pedagogy reviewer rated the deck positively (5/8 patterns fully followed, 2/8 partially applied, 1/8 not applicable). Key findings:

- **Strengths**: Good motivation-before-formalism structure, excellent worked examples after every concept, consistent semantic color usage (red for bad, teal for good), thorough presenter notes
- **Minor suggestions**: Could add one more discussion prompt in the Git section, could swap Makefile code/DAG slide order
- **Applied fix**: Added Makefile tab warning directly on-slide (was only in notes)

## Visual Audit Summary

The slide auditor identified 1 high-severity and 5 medium-severity issues:

- **Fixed**: Makefile slide reduced from 19 to 10 lines (switched to `\scriptsize`, removed blank lines)
- **Fixed**: Long URL on intro slide replaced with citation reference
- **Remaining**: No issues after fixes

## Images Needed

This deck contains no external images --- all diagrams are built with TikZ. The instructor may want to add:

- A screenshot of a real GitHub replication repository
- An xkcd or similar comic about version control (the reference slides had `img/xkcd.png`)
- Screenshots showing good vs. bad project folder structures

# Assignment

## Structure

**Assignment 5: Best Practices in Computing** (7 pages, due March 12)

- **Part 1 (In-Class)**: Project organization using the corruption dataset
  - Folder structure, analysis script, plots script, Makefile
- **Part 2 (Take-Home)**: Code quality and Git practices
  - Rewrite a "bad" R script, practice Git commits, write reflection

## Datasets

- `corruption.dta` --- 170 observations, 5 variables (`ccode`, `cname`, `ccodealp`, `ti_cpi`, `undp_gdp`)
- Available at: `github.com/franvillamil/AQM2/tree/master/datasets/other`
- URL verified: accessible

## Checker Results

- **URLs**: All accessible
- **Variable names**: All consistent with dataset columns
- **R code blocks**: All valid syntax, tested successfully
- **Packages**: `readstata13`, `modelsummary`, `ggplot2` --- all available on CRAN
- **Compilation**: Clean (0 overfull hbox warnings, 0 errors)

## Placeholders

- **Deadline**: March 12, before class (set)
- No other placeholders remaining

# Solutions

## Files Created

| File | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| `assign5_1.Rmd` | Part 1 solution (project organization) | Knits to PDF |
| `assign5_1.R` | Bare R script for Part 1 | Created |
| `assign5_2.Rmd` | Part 2 solution (code quality, Git) | Knits to PDF |
| `assign5_2.R` | Bare R script for Part 2 (improved script) | Created |
| `code/assign5.R` | Combined script | Created |

## Knitting Status

- `assign5_1.Rmd`: Knits successfully (warnings about unknown `markdown` and `makefile` engines are harmless)
- `assign5_2.Rmd`: Knits successfully (all code chunks are `eval=FALSE` since they reference hypothetical data)

# Quality Scores

| Artifact | Score | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Slides | 95/100 | Acceptable |
| Assignment | 100/100 | Acceptable |
| Solution Part 1 | 95/100 | Acceptable (minor engine warnings) |
| Solution Part 2 | 100/100 | Acceptable |

# Issues Requiring Attention

1. **Images**: The slide deck has no external images. Consider adding 1-2 images for visual variety (see suggestions above).

2. **Slide auditor note**: The "Key resources" slide (slide 25) is vertically dense with 5 resources. May need adjustment if it overflows on the specific projector setup.

3. **Assignment note**: The corruption dataset has no missing values on `ti_cpi` or `undp_gdp`, so the "drop missing" step removes 0 rows. Students may find this confusing. Consider mentioning this in class or in the solution.

4. **Solution note**: The `assign5_1.Rmd` solution downloads the corruption data from GitHub (URL) rather than loading it from a local path, since the solution runs independently of the assignment folder structure.
