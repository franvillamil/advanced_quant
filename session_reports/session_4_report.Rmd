# Slides

## Overview

- **File:** `slides/04_interpretation/interpretation_body.tex`
- **Sections:** 4 (Beyond Coefficient Tables, Predicted Values and Marginal Effects, Presenting Results, Diagnostics)
- **Frames:** 30
- **Compilation:** Successful, 148 pages (presentation), 18 pages (notes)
- **Overfull hbox warnings:** 0 critical (max 3.5pt, well within tolerance)

## Content

The slides cover model interpretation from multiple angles:

1. **Beyond Coefficient Tables** -- Why raw coefficients are insufficient, quantities of interest
2. **Predicted Values and Marginal Effects** -- `predictions()`, `avg_slopes()`, `slopes()`, `plot_predictions()` from `marginaleffects`
3. **Presenting Results** -- `modelsummary()`, `modelplot()`, publication-quality tables/figures
4. **Diagnostics** -- Residual analysis, influential observations, Cook's distance, heteroskedasticity, robust SEs

All frames use tikz diagrams (no external images needed). Every frame has a `\note{}` block.

# Assignment 4

## Overview

- **File:** `assignments/assign4_interpretation.tex`
- **Pages:** 8
- **Compilation:** Successful, 0 overfull hbox warnings
- **Deadline:** March 5, before class

## Structure

- **Part 1 (In-Class):** Corruption and Wealth -- 8 subsections using `corruption.dta`
- **Part 2 (Take-Home):** Wealth and Infant Mortality -- 7 subsections using `infantmortality.dta`

## Assignment Checker Results

- **Score:** 98/100
- **URLs:** All 5 checked, all returned HTTP 200
- **Datasets:** Both load correctly with expected variables
- **R code blocks:** All 15 blocks tested successfully
- **Packages:** All 5 required packages available
- **LaTeX:** Balanced environments, no placeholders

### Issue Found and Fixed

| Severity | Description | Action |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| Minor | Region label said "Asia and Oceania" but data has "Asia" | Fixed (changed to "Asia") |

# Solutions

## Part 1: Corruption and Wealth

- **Rmd:** `assignments/solution/assign4_1.Rmd` -- knits to PDF successfully
- **R script:** `assignments/solution/assign4_1.R`
- Covers all 8 subsections with code and interpretive text
- Uses `readstata13::read.dta13()` to load data from course GitHub
- Demonstrates `predictions()`, `avg_slopes()`, `slopes()`, `plot_predictions()`
- Residual diagnostics with `broom::augment()` and Cook's distance
- Publication table with `modelsummary(vcov = "robust")`

## Part 2: Wealth and Infant Mortality

- **Rmd:** `assignments/solution/assign4_2.Rmd` -- knits to PDF successfully
- **R script:** `assignments/solution/assign4_2.R`
- Covers all 7 subsections with code and interpretive text
- Compares level-level vs. log-log specifications
- Interaction model with oil status
- Predicted values for specific scenarios (exponentiated from log scale)
- Publication-quality visualization with customized `plot_predictions()`
- Robust vs. default SE comparison

## Combined Code

- **File:** `assignments/code/assign4.R` -- combines both parts in a single script

# Issues Requiring Attention

1. **No external images in slides:** All frames use tikz diagrams. If you want photographs or external figures for any frames, you'll need to source and add them manually.

2. **Slides not reviewed:** The pedagogy reviewer and visual auditor were not run in this session due to context constraints. Consider reviewing the slides manually for:
   - Narrative flow across sections
   - Slide density (30 frames may be dense for one session)
   - Balance between code-heavy and conceptual slides

3. **Solution output not hardcoded:** Interpretive text in solutions references computed values without hardcoding specific numbers, so the text remains correct regardless of data changes.
